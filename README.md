## Getting started

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator **globally**: `npm install -g generator-express`
- Run: `yo express` and select Basic. Add `--coffee` if you require CoffeeScript.
- Run: `grunt` or `gulp` to run the local server at `localhost:3000`, the grunt/gulp tasks include live reloading for views, css in public/css and restarting the server for changes to app.js or js in routes/

## MVC apps

A generator for creating MVC style apps in express. Giving you the choice between the supported databases.

To get going:

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator **locally**: `npm install generator-express`
- Run: `yo express`, select MVC and select your database of choice. Add `--coffee` if you require CoffeeScript.
- Ensure that the selected database is running on your machine, if running elsewhere the connection string can be changed in `config/config.js`
- Run: `grunt` or `gulp` to run the local server - defaults to `localhost:3000` - port can be changed in `config/config.js`. The grunt/gulp tasks include live reloading as before.

## Options

- `--coffee`

  Uses CoffeeScript.

- `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after
  scaffolding has finished.

## Testing
Tests are written with mocha.
- Install: `npm install -g mocha`
- Run: `mocha` or `npm test`
